# Todo

## Basic configuration

The objective here is to create a functional "comprehensive" that will be used to further rapid prototyping.

- start with an empty framework (201n10-Framework)
- add a basic header and main
- add two sections, one for the survey and one for the prestart instructions
- add 3 images (not random) to the survey and style to with cookie-stand shop theme.
- add some boilerplate html to the prestart section. a form, some lorem ipsum
- add some javascript to hide the prestart and display the survey sections
- add some javascript for the "links" in the header

## Add the form to the researcher prestart section

- Collect a participants name and generate a GUID to uniquely identify the user in the reports.

## Add a report section (not a page) to display tables (pivots? stretch!)

- Display tables of all users that have take the survey.
- Create summary/detail or just detail? (stretch)

## Ensure the images scale horizontally, and don't automatically float (flex) down the page

- The instructions say always ensure they are three across. Scale the images with the window rather than slide them down the page.
- Test on Blisk
